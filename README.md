# On the Frobenius Number of certain numerical semigroups

Let 0≤λ be a real and p a prime number, 
with  [p,p+λp]  containing at least two primes. 
Denote by  f_λ the largest integer which 
cannot be written as a sum of primes from  [p,p+λp]. 

Then 

f_λ∼⌊2+2/λ⌋p 

as p  goes to infnity.

Further a question of Wilf about 
the 'Money Changing Problem' has a 
positive answer for all semigroups of 
multiplicity  p  containing the primes 
from [p,2p]. 

In particular, this holds for the 
semigroup generated by all primes not less than p.

# Repo

This repository contains the source code for the 
article *On the Frobenius number of certain numerical semigroups* 
by R. Waldi, M. Hellus and A. Rechenauer.

There are five little programs, implemented in GAP and Rust
which show the numerical evidence for various assertions
and conjectures in the article. 

For large numbers the Rust versions are more performant than the
GAP implementations (these were mainly used for checking the results). 
For example the computation of the table 
```t4_quotient_not_always_6```
took about 24 hours on a modern desktop, while it seemed impossible
to wait for the results of the GAP version.

## t4
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/t4
```
creates a csv-file use to check f/p for primes in T(4)

## all_lambda
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/all_lambda
```
creates a csv-file which varies q while
computing the ng generated by the primes in the  
interval [p..q] for the fixed prime 48623

## full
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/full
```
creates a csv which computes the numerical
semigroup generated by *all primes* not less then
p for various primes p.

## plots
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/plots >../target/plots_from_rust.csv
```
creates a csv which is used by the 
python script py/plot.py to draw some pictures

## frobeniusnumber
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/frobeniusnumber
```
creates a csv which computes the numerical
semigroup generated by all primes between 
p and 2p (and gives evidence for f/p ~ 4)

(this is the rust main.rs)
