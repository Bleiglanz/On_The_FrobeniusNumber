# On the Frobenius Number of certain numerical semigroups

Let 0≤λ be a real and p a prime number, 
with  [p,p+λp]  containing at least two primes. 
Denote by  f_λ the largest integer which 
cannot be written as a sum of primes from  [p,p+λp]. 

Then 

f_λ∼⌊2+2λ⌋p 

as p  goes to infnity.

Further a question of Wilf about 
the 'Money Changing Problem' has a 
positive answer for all semigroups of 
multiplicity  p  containing the primes 
from [p,2p]. 

In particular, this holds for the 
semigroup generated by all primes not less than p.

#Repo

This repository contains the source code for the 
article TODO.

There are for little programs, implemented in GAP and Rust
which show the numerical evidence 

##t4
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/t4
```
computes a csv which checks f/p for primes in T(4)

##all_lambda
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/all_primes
```
creates a csv which varies q in the 
interval [p..q] for the fixed prime 48623

##full
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/full
```
creates a csv which computes the numerical
subgrup generated by all primes not less then
p for various primes p

##frobeniusnumber
```
cargo b --release && ./target/release/frobeniusnumber
```
creates a csv which computes the numerical
subgrup generated by all primes between 
p and 2p.
